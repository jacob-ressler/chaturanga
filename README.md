# Chaturanga

It's chess! With 4 players! And dice! And... a boat?

Chaturanga is a 4-player board game. It plays very similarly to chess, but with a few twists and extra mechanics. Check out the [store page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Livid.Chaturanga) for a more detailed explanation.

This was my first project in Unity and my first public mobile app release. Needless to say, it's
far from perfect. I'm sure a lot of the things I did in making this were wrong or unconventional, so I plan to dive back in over summer 2019 to clean up and improve as much as I can.

## Getting started

### **Download**

I do not plan to release DRM-free builds, but you are free to create your own. The latest release build will always be available for free on the [store page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Livid.Chaturanga).

### **Usage with Unity**

Follow these steps to set up the project for development in Unity:

1. [Download](https://github.com/jacob-ressler/chaturanga/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repository
2. Extract it to an empty folder
3. Launch Unity and select **Open** from the launcher
4. Navigate to the folder containing the extracted repository and select it
5. Existing game scenes are available under `Assets > Scenes` in the Project Heirarchy

And there you go, your Unity project is all set for development!
